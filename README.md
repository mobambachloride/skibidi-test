# tiny-cosmos

A tiny Node.js project that gives you a **daily personalized coding mission** and a procedural mini starfield in your terminal.

## Quick start

```bash
npm start
```

Pass a custom name:

```bash
npm start -- "Skibidi Dev"
```

## Why this is cool

- Deterministic daily output: same person + same date = same mission.
- Different people get different callsigns/missions.
- Zero dependencies.
- Includes tests using Node's built-in test runner.

## Scripts

- `npm start` → run the cosmic briefing CLI.
- `npm test` → run unit tests.
